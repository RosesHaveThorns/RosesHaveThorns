# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Rose Awen Brindle [@RosesHaveThorns]

I'm a Data Analyst with at [AberInstruments](https://aberinstruments.com/), supporting the manufacturing team and wider business with data insights and investigations. In this I work primarily with PowerBI, Python and Excel/PowerQuery.

In my free time I mostly work with C, Java and Python, plus a bit of HTML/CSS/PHP/JS when I feel up to doing some web dev.  My interest areas are varied, ranging from weather and climate simulation to folklore. Previously I studied Space Science and Robotics and worked with a research team at Aberystwyth University on fish-inspired robotic design and control.

# üöß Current and Previous Projects

- [Fish-inspired Robotics](https://github.com/aberfish): Research into the ability of a robot to mimic fish in behavoir and function. Worked on code and data analysis for a wheeled robot to test fish behavoir algorithms and a fish robot to test fish inspired hardware design.
- [ClWxSim](https://github.com/RosesHaveThorns/C_ClWxSim): A weather simulator which I originally coded in Python, now being rewritten in C
- [Project Altair](https://github.com/RosesHaveThorns/ProjectAltair): A barebones x86 OS, built from scratch using assembly language and C
- [TilesWorlds](https://github.com/RosesHaveThorns/Tiles-Worlds): A deck-building, tile based strategy game created using Unity
- [Transdata](https://trans-data.net/): A frontend website for a database of Transgender Research, created using CSS, HTML, PHP and JS, using an Algolia Search Database 
- [LibraryOfVerbena](https://libraryofverbena.xyz/): A website frontend for a database of books my partner and I own, created using CSS, HTML, PHP and JS and hosted using NGINX. Data is stored using Algolia.
